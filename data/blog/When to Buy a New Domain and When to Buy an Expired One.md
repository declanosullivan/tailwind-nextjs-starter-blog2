# When to Buy a New Domain and When to Buy an Expired One

## The Domain Selection Dilemma

Over 150,000 domain names expire every day, with 70% of all domains not being renewed each year ([Quora][1]). This presents multiple choices in domain selection, very much like choosing between a new or used car. Both options have their benefits and drawbacks, and selecting the right domain depends on factors such as your needs, budget, and competition within your industry. In this article, we will explore how to make the right choice that will help establish your business online.

## The Appeal of a New Domain

Having a unique domain name can greatly help your business by maintaining brand ownership, boosting your SEO, competing with other businesses, and more ([UENI Blog][2]). Much like the allure of a new car, a brand new domain name offers a fresh start and ensures you don't inherit any negative reputation associated with a previously owned domain. With a clean slate, you can avoid concerns about spam or shady business dealings. However, like a new car with zero miles on it, a new domain requires building web traffic and establishing an audience from scratch. If you are seeking a domain name that gives you a competitive advantage, an expired domain might be a better option.

## The Potential of Expired Domains

Of the domains that are not renewed each year, 41% expire and 29% will be registered by someone else ([Quora][3]). This suggests that there is a significant opportunity to acquire expired domain names, which often come with developed SEO value and existing traffic ([Quora][4]). Acquiring a reputable expired domain name can provide you with an existing audience, established backlinks, and incoming web traffic. This advantage enables you to leverage marketing efforts more effectively, making it easier to reach potential customers and convert them into buyers. However, there is a downside to purchasing a second-hand domain: you may not know the full story behind it. There could be a negative reputation associated with spam or other issues that you will need to overcome.

## Making the Decision

Choosing to re-register an expired domain is equivalent to taking over a car with existing enhancements, potentially giving you a head start in a competitive market ([Quora][5]). Ultimately, the choice between a new or expired domain name depends on your business and its goals, both in the short and long term. Assessing your industry landscape will help you identify your options. In a highly competitive market, starting with an expired domain that already has traffic and backlinks can position your business on par with established competitors. On the other hand, if you have few competitors or are confident in your ability to build traffic from scratch, a new domain name can still lead to success with the right strategy.

## Impact of Domain Choice

An appropriate web domain can significantly impact your reach and presence in the digital spaceâ€” a key determinant of success in today's digital age ([UENI Blog][6]). If you prefer starting slow and taking full control of your business's growth, a new domain name is likely the better choice. This allows you to make all the decisions yourself and build your online presence from the ground up. However, if you seek a head start and want to hit the ground running with existing web traffic that you can build upon, an established domain name is worth exploring.
