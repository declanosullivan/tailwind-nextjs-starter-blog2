# Why a Premium Domain Name Makes Sense for Your Business

The internet, an expansive cyber frontier, shelters a massive 1.29 billion live websites as of January 2020 [Total number of Websites][1]. This, against a colossal growth rate, results in about 33,000 domain registrations daily, equal to one new domain every 2.61 seconds [How to Check Domain History Before Buying a …][2]. Nonetheless, every registered domain does not necessarily turn into an active website. For instance, by 2017, a hefty 330.6 million domain names had been registered [Why a Premium Domain Name Makes Sense for Your ...][3]. It is clear that the number of registered domain names far outstrips the count of active sites.

Since the historical registration of the first domain name in March 1985 [Why a Premium Domain Name Makes Sense for Your ...][4], the hunt for a fitting domain name has grown significantly challenging. The popularity of dictionary words and common extensions have mothered a scarcity of available alternatives, making it increasingly difficult to secure a domain that encapsulates a brand or business perfectly.

But what's the workaround in a scenario where attractive domains seem scarce? Contrary to popular opinion, a registered domain is not necessarily unavailable. A vibrant market thrives on the buying, selling, and investing of domains, particularly premium ones.

Premium domains, already registered and acknowledged valuable, are succinct and rich in keywords, often justifying their high price tag. Despite the initial cost, investing in a premium domain could rack up substantial savings, saving massive marketing expenses that a below-par domain might demand.

## Advantages of Embracing a Premium Domain Name for Business Growth
